# Weather Dashboard App

## Description

When making this weather app my main goals were to 

- Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.

- Present the user with current conditions of the cosen city and that city is added to the search history.

When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:

- The city name

- A background picture specific to that location

- The date

- An icon representation of weather conditions

- The temperature

- The humidity

- The wind speed

## Challenges 

When first creating this I was not able to get the data forecast for the next 5 days so I've had to adapt and change the API I was using. 
In the future I would make it better by learning how to add the geotag coordinates to cities then adding the 5 days forecast API.
